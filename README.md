# Welcome
This is the source code for my personal site & blog. [Click here for the live version](https://bigcheeze45.github.io/)

## Setup
The site is put together using a combination of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (to build the website), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (for hosting), and [GitHub's API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) (to automatically populate site with Github content (repos, avatar)). See [GitHub personal site generator](https://github.dev/) for more information.

## License
The theme is available as open source under the terms of the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).
